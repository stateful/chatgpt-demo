Magic isn't always unicorns and fairy dust␊
Sometimes it's computer code and technology that's quite a bit of work␊
But if you learn the tricks and the trades␊
You'll find there's a wonder that awaits␊

With a computer and some basic coding␊
You can make anything your heart desires␊
From games that you'll play for hours on end␊
To apps that will make life much more fun␊

So don't be afraid of the unknown␊
Embrace the magic of computer code␊
And you'll find that your dreams can come true␊
With just a little bit of coding, you can do anything too!
